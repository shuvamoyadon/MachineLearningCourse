    <h2 style="color: #0d47a1;">Understanding the Main Categories of Machine Learning</h2>
    <p style="color: #000000;">Machine Learning can be broadly categorized into three main types, each with its unique approach to learning from data.</p>
</div>

## 1. 🔍 Supervised Learning

<div style="background-color: #e8f5e9; padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px 0; color: #000000;">
    <h3 style="color: #1b5e20;">Learning with Labeled Data</h3>
    <p style="color: #000000;">The algorithm learns from labeled training data, helping predict outcomes for unseen data.</p>
    
    **Examples with Data:**
    - 🏠 House Price Prediction
      - Input: Size (sq.ft), Bedrooms, Location
      - Output: Price ($)
      ```
      | Size | Bedrooms | Location | Price    |
      |------|----------|----------|----------|
      | 1500 | 2        | Urban    | $350,000 |
      | 2000 | 3        | Suburban | $420,000 |
      | 1200 | 2        | Rural    | $280,000 |
      ```
    
    - 📧 Spam Detection
      - Input: Email content
      - Output: Spam (1) or Not Spam (0)
</div>

## 2. 🔮 Unsupervised Learning

<div style="background-color: #fff3e0; padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px 0; color: #000000;">
    <h3 style="color: #e65100;">Finding Hidden Patterns</h3>
    <p style="color: #000000;">Works with unlabeled data to find hidden patterns or intrinsic structures.</p>
    
    **Examples with Data:**
    - 🛒 Customer Segmentation
      ```
      Customer Purchase Data:
      | Customer | Electronics | Groceries | Clothing |
      |----------|-------------|-----------|----------|
      | A        | 8           | 2         | 5        |
      | B        | 2           | 9         | 3        |
      | C        | 7           | 1         | 6        |
      ```
      → Groups customers based on spending patterns
    
    - 🎨 Image Compression
      - Reduces image size by grouping similar pixels
</div>

## 3. 🎮 Reinforcement Learning

<div style="background-color: #f3e5f5; padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px 0;">
    <h3 style="color: #4a148c;">Learning by Interaction</h3>
    <p style="color: #212121;">An agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize rewards.</p>
    
    **Examples with Data:**
    - 🤖 Game Playing (Chess)
      ```
      State: Board position
      Action: Move piece
      Reward: +1 for win, -1 for loss, 0 for draw
      ```
    - 🚗 Self-driving Cars
      - Action: Steer left/right, accelerate/brake
      - Reward: + for safe driving, - for violations
</div>

## 🏭 Batch/Offline Machine Learning

<div style="background-color: #e8f5ff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px 0; color: #000000;">
    <h3 style="color: #0d47a1;">Learning from Historical Data</h3>
    <p style="color: #000000;">Batch learning processes the entire dataset at once to train a model. The model is trained on a fixed dataset and then deployed without further learning.</p>
    
    **Key Characteristics:**
    - Processes all training data at once
    - No continuous learning after deployment
    - Requires retraining with new data
    - More computationally intensive per training
    - Better for stable environments
    
    **Example: Monthly Sales Prediction**
    
    Let's say we're predicting next month's sales for a retail store:
    ```
    Training Data (Past 2 Years):
    | Month   | Marketing Spend | Holidays | Competitor Sales | Actual Sales |
    |---------|-----------------|----------|------------------|--------------|
    | Jan-2023| $10,000        | 1        | $120,000        | $150,000    |
    | Feb-2023| $12,000        | 0        | $115,000        | $145,000    |
    | ...     | ...             | ...      | ...              | ...         |
    | Dec-2024| $15,000        | 1        | $130,000        | $170,000    |
    ```
    
    **Process:**
    1. Collect 2 years of historical data
    2. Train the model once on this complete dataset
    3. Deploy the trained model
    4. Use it to predict next month's sales
    5. Retrain monthly with new data
    
    **When to Use Batch Learning:**
    - When you have a fixed dataset
    - When predictions don't need to be updated in real-time
    - When computational resources are limited during inference
    - For stable environments where patterns don't change quickly
    
    **Common Use Cases:**
    - Monthly sales forecasting
    - Credit scoring models
    - Customer churn prediction
    - Sentiment analysis on historical data

    **Advantages of Batch Processing:**
    - ✅ **Computationally Efficient**: Can leverage full dataset for better optimization
    - ✅ **Stable Training**: Less prone to noisy updates compared to online learning
    - ✅ **Simplicity**: Easier to implement and debug
    - ✅ **Reproducibility**: Same data always produces the same model
    - ✅ **Better for Small Datasets**: More effective when data quantity is limited
    - ✅ **Resource Management**: Can be scheduled during off-peak hours

    **Disadvantages of Batch Processing:**
    - ⚠️ **Not Real-time**: Cannot learn from new data without retraining
    - ⚠️ **Resource Intensive**: Requires significant memory for large datasets
    - ⚠️ **Stale Models**: Model becomes outdated between retraining cycles
    - ⚠️ **No Adaptation**: Cannot adjust to sudden changes in data patterns
    - ⚠️ **Longer Training Time**: Must process entire dataset for each update
    - ⚠️ **Storage Requirements**: Need to store entire training dataset

    **When to Choose Batch Over Online Learning:**
    - When you have limited computational resources for inference
    - When data patterns are relatively stable over time
    - When you can tolerate some delay in model updates
    - When you need to ensure model stability and consistency
    - When working with smaller datasets that fit in memory
